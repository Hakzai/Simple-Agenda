# Simple-Agenda
Agenda example built with C

This simple app was made during college classes to understand more and work the concepts of pointers and file manipulation in C language.

In this project I didn't used the concepts of functions, only the main function itself. 
The other C project, the market, in my hub uses this concept very well.
